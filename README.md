First repository

Hello everyone, 

I'm new on GitHub and looking to expand on my programming skills. I am a recent college graduate and have done projects in C#, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to name a few I will be working on expanding my knowledge in those computer languages and picking up a few more along the way. I started my journey into the programming world 5 years ago and I'm excited to start my new career now that I have graduated college.
